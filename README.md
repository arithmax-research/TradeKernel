## Overview
TradeKernel is a deterministic operating system engineered for high-frequency trading (HFT), written in C++ and x86_64 Assembly. It eliminates traditional OS jitter through a custom tickless scheduler, kernel-bypass networking, and pre-allocated memory pools to achieve sub-microsecond latency.

## Features

- **32-bit Protected Mode**: Complete transition from 16-bit real mode
- **VGA Text Mode Driver**: 80x25 color text display with scrolling
- **Memory Management**: Simple heap allocator with malloc/free functionality
- **Interrupt Handling**: Keyboard and timer interrupt support
- **Interactive Console**: Real-time keyboard input processing
- **Clean Architecture**: Modular design with separate drivers and subsystems

## Building and Running

### Prerequisites

Install the required development tools:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install build-essential nasm qemu-system-x86
```

### Quick Start

1. **Clone and navigate to the project:**
   ```bash
   cd TradeKernel-ArithmaX-Customized
   ```

2. **Build and run the OS:**
   ```bash
   ./run_tradeos.sh
   ```

3. **For quick development testing:**
   ```bash
   ./quick_test.sh
   ```

### Manual Build

```bash
# Clean previous builds
make -f Makefile.new clean

# Build the OS image
make -f Makefile.new all

# Run in QEMU
make -f Makefile.new run
```

### QEMU Controls

- **Ctrl+Alt+G**: Release mouse from QEMU window
- **Ctrl+Alt+2**: Switch to QEMU monitor console
- **Ctrl+Alt+1**: Return to OS display
- **Ctrl+C**: Quit QEMU (in terminal)

## System Specifications

- **Target Architecture**: x86 (32-bit)
- **Memory Layout**:
  - Bootloader: 0x7C00 (loaded by BIOS)
  - Kernel: 0x10000 (64KB)
  - Kernel Heap: 0x100000 (1MB+, 4MB allocated)
- **VGA Text Mode**: 80x25 characters, 16 colors
- **Interrupts**: Timer (IRQ 0) and Keyboard (IRQ 1)

## Development

### Adding New Features

1. **Drivers**: Add new device drivers in `kernel/drivers/`
2. **System Calls**: Extend interrupt handling in `kernel/arch/`
3. **Memory**: Enhance memory management in `kernel/mm/`
4. **Algorithms**: Build trading algorithms on top of the kernel foundation

### Debugging

Use QEMU's debugging features:

```bash
# Start with GDB server
make -f Makefile.new debug

# In another terminal, connect with GDB
gdb
(gdb) target remote :1234
(gdb) symbol-file build/kernel.bin
```

## File Structure

- `run_tradeos.sh`: Main build and run script
- `quick_test.sh`: Quick development testing
- `Makefile.new`: Build system configuration
- `kernel/`: All kernel source code
- `build/`: Generated build artifacts (created during build)

## Testing

The OS provides an interactive console where you can:

- Type characters using the keyboard
- See real-time text output
- Observe interrupt handling in action
- Test memory allocation (can be extended)

## Development Roadmap

### Phase 1: Core System Features (Essential)

#### 1. File System
- **Simple FAT-like filesystem** for storing trading strategies and data
- **Basic file operations**: create, read, write, delete files

**Example Future Commands:**
```bash
$ ls                    # List files and directories
$ mkdir strategies      # Create directory for trading algorithms
$ cat strategy.txt      # Display file contents
$ edit myalgo.c        # Built-in text editor
$ compile myalgo.c     # Compile trading strategy
$ run myalgo           # Execute trading algorithm
$ netstat              # Show network connections
$ top                  # Show running processes
$ df                   # Show disk usage
```
